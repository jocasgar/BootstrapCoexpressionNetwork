# BootstrapCoexpressionNetwork

In this project, a bootstrapping method has been designed, implemented and tested for the construction of co-expression networks that extends the algorithm given in the CoExpNets package.

To test the effectiveness of this new method a simulation process has been carried out, which implementation can be found in the document `SimulationAnalysis.Rmd`.
